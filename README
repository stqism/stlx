The root of the stlx project, a debian based distro optimized for gaming, and only gaming.
Stlx boots directly in to steams big picture mode, running under openbox.

Future releases will feature scripts to set up proprietary drivers, wayland support, and anything else that optimizes the gaming experience on linux.
